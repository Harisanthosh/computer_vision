He uses a machine that quickly scans many photos. But depending on the orientation of the original photo, many images are digitized sideways.  He fixes these manually, looking at each photo to determine which ones to rotate.\n\nIn this exercise, you will build a model that distinguishes which photos are sideways and which are upright, so an app could automatically rotate each image if necessary.\n\nIf you were going to sell this service commercially, you might use a large dataset to train the model. But you'll have great success with even a small dataset.  You'll work with a small dataset of dog pictures, half of which are rotated sideways.\n\nSpecifying and compiling the model look the same as in the example you've seen. But you'll need to make some changes to fit the model.\n\n**Run the following cell to set up automatic feedback.**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Set up code checking\nfrom learntools.core import binder\nbinder.bind(globals())\nfrom learntools.deep_learning.exercise_4 import *\nprint(\"Setup Complete\")","execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":"Setup Complete\n","name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1) Specify the Model\n\nSince this is your first time, we'll provide some starter code for you to modify.
